## Description

Nest is a powerful web framework for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), which helps you effortlessly build efficient, scalable applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and combines best concepts of both OOP (Object Oriented Progamming) and FP (Functional Programming).

It is not just another framework. You do not have to wait for a large community, because Nest is built with awesome, popular well-known libraries - [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io)! It means, that you could quickly start using framework without worrying about a third party plugins.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install nest.js
```

## Philosophy

JavaScript is awesome. This language is no longer just a trash to create simple animations in the browser. Right now, the front end world is rich in variety of tools. We have a lot of amazing frameworks / libraries such as [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) or [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), which improves our development process and makes our applications fast and flexible. 

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) gave us a possibility to use this language also on the server side. There are a lot of superb libraries, helpers and tools for node, but non of them do not solve the main problem - the architecture. 

We want to create scalable, modern and easy to maintain applications. Nest helps us with it.

## Features

- Compatible with both TypeScript and ES6 (I strongly recommend to use [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org))
- Based on well-known libraries ([Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) / [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io)) so you could share your experience 
- Easy to learn - syntax is similar to [Angular](https://angular.io/) / [Spring](https://spring.io) (Java)
- Dependency Injection, built-in **Inversion of Control** container
- Exceptions handler layer (helps to focus on logic)
- Own modularity system (split your system into reusable modules)
- **WebSockets** module (based on [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io))
- Reactive **microservices** support with messages patterns (transport via TCP / [Redis](https://redis.io/))
- Testing utilities
